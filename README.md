## PetGallery

This is a demo including a list of breeds. This app has been made using [`Model-View-Presenter`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) pattern as well as including [`View-Model`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) to reduce contracts between the `Presenter` and its `View`.
It is also making use of the [`Repository Pattern`](https://medium.com/@krzychukosobudzki/repository-design-pattern-bc490b256006)
